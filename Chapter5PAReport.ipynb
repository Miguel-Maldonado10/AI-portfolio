    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "This assigment implements and tests an adversarial‐search agent for the classic game of Domino, using **Monte Carlo simulation**.  \n",
    "We generate the full domino set, deal hands to two players (human vs. AI), and use randomized rollouts from each candidate move to estimate win probabilities.  \n",
    "This approach requires minimal game‐modeling, scales linearly with the number of simulations, and naturally handles hidden‐tile uncertainty without explicit belief‐state tracking.  \n"

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Domino is a two‐player tile‐matching game in which each player seeks to exhaust their hand by matching pips on either end of a growing chain.  \n",
    "Adversarial‐search techniques like minimax or POMDP solvers can become complex when faced with hidden information and large branching factors.  \n",
    "Monte Carlo simulation sidesteps these challenges by performing many **random rollouts** from each possible move and selecting the move with the best average outcome.  \n"

    "## Information & Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "We selected Monte Carlo simulation for it's ease of implementation as we found DNNs to be much more complicated and required training and licenses. DNNs might be a bit overkill while Monte Carlo might be able to find new and different outcomes to which we can't train our Deep Neural Network for. We found Monte Carlo simulation to  to be a practical approach that directly tackles the stochastic and partially observable nature of Dominoes without requiring hard to design heuristic functions or DNNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Domino & Player classes**  \n",
    "   - `Domino(p1, p2)`: represents one tile, supports flipping and value access.  \n",
    "   - `Player(name)`: holds a hand, can play and check for legal moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **MonteCarloAgent (subclass of Player)**  \n",
    "   - `legal_moves(board, hand)`: enumerate indices of playable tiles.  \n",
    "   - `simulate_playout(board, hands, current_idx)`: deep‐copy state, then loop random legal moves until someone wins or the game blocks; returns +1/–1/0.  \n",
    "   - `choose_move(board, hands, current_idx)`: for each legal move, apply it, run N rollouts, average the results, and pick the highest‐scoring move.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **GameEnvironment**  \n",
    "   - Builds and shuffles the 28‐tile set, deals 7 tiles each.  \n",
    "   - Manages the turn loop, calling `choose_move` for the AI or prompting human input.  \n",
    "   - Detects win or blocked‐game, and computes pip‐sum tiebreakers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Tunable parameters**  \n",
    "   - `num_rollouts` controls the trade‐off between decision quality and compute time.\n"

    "\n",
    "We have successfully implemented a Monte Carlo–based adversarial agent for Domino. By performing randomized rollouts for each candidate move, the AI handles hidden information without explicit probability models, and its strength scales with the number of simulations. This clean separation of game logic and search policy offers a robust, tunable baseline for further enhancements.\n"
