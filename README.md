# AI-portfolio
## Purpose

This portfolio is made as a demonstration of my progress, learnings and accomplishments of in my ICOM5015 Artificial Intelligence class. Artificial Intelligence is proof that with rationality and optimization us as people can implement many fields of study to create new solutions. 


## Developments 

### Chapter I - Introductions

Before working on it we must first understand the concept of intelligence. In our first forum I expressed my initial understanding of intelligence, as "Intelligence to me is the processing of information and filtering that of which is ethical and not ethical, logical and not logical as well filtering what we know and what we can learn more from. It can be spread out into different subjects, but fundamentally is how we understand and distinguish what is true and not in the world around us."

Upon researching the subject we had to write in a forum our findings. This was my post - "Intelligence the process of receiving, processing and storing information, identifying problems and solutions to them from our experiences with the ends of survival. it is measured by how efficient we are in solving our day to day problems we face. I.E. Racoon's were tested by how fast they could open different types of doorknobs/mechanical knobs and through the act of doing they speed up the process of opening said doors. Some neurobiology studies say that it was observed how our intelligence is directly proportionate to the neuroplasticity of our brains. In simpler terms, the more efficient the connections within our brain, the more intelligent the being is."

After further studies, on intelligence we were assigned on writing an essay on whether or not artificial intelligence qualifies as real intelligence to which I link my essay on the matter below.

### Chapter II - Agents

An agent is anything that can be viewed as receiving information from its environment through sensors and acting up on that environment through sensors and acting up on that environment through actuators. To evaluate these we learned the PEAS analysis system. P - Perfomance, E - Environment, A - Actuators and S - Sensors. We were assigned to do a practical implementation of AI using PEAS analysis on any idea realistic in the near future. I will include my forum post below.

"When I was in middle school I was fortunate enough to take a technology class. In it our final project was to create a design of a "robot" of any sort. We didn't have any limitations as to what it could be for nor what it could do. At the time I had a important person to me being in intensive care so I came up with the idea of a Robot caretaker for people later in their years. This robot would move around their patient being specialized to fetch the necessities and overview the health of the patient using external peripherals, being able to contact emergency services in case of a health crisis were to occur to a patient.

Performance - A good performance metric would be client satisfaction. As though caretakers, ideally are service workers, the satisfaction of the client is of upmost priority. Another would be Task Efficiency like the rate of which it completes scheduled set task and it navigates around.

Environment - The environment is parially observable as with the use of interconnected peripherals the AI can use, it will not be able to completely observe everything due to the inherent complexities of human experience and technological limitations. It would also be Strategic as it depends on other agents, like the patient, their families, healthcare providers, etc.. It would have a sequential environment as it's current actions will determine the long term health of the patient. Finally the environment is also dynamic and continuous. That is because the patient is expected to keep moving constantly so the AI would have to keep up with it and it's continuous because It doesn't have a predetermined max time of service.

Actuators - As for movement actuators could be omnidirectional wheels, we would need it to grab medicine or open doors so a robotic arm would be practical and maybe a elevating mechanism to help it reach stuff in higher places. The robotic arm would need a gripper, we'd need a voice synthesizer, a touch screen for ease of use. Finally it'd definitely need an emergency alert system as to get in contact with the authorities if anything were to happen.

Sensors -  Heart rate monitor, Blood pressure monitor, temperature sensor, respiration rate sensor and a pulse oximeter would be crucial for vital sign monitoring. We would need cameras, proximity sensors and a sonar sensor to move around and for interacting with the patient we'd need touch sensors and microphones.

We also did a study to see if python is fast or slow on which I will link to the video with our results - https://youtu.be/0hEylpkEBtk and did a programming assignment in this chapter for agents. These are our results on our programming assignment for agents - https://youtu.be/oJgBcUDebY8. PDFs will be available for the programming projects of this chapter and all essays as though we had not picked up Jupyter Notebook at the time and all the video presentations are in Spanish.

### Chapter III - Solving Problems by Search 

In this chapter we covered the basic concepts of search. I learned that finding one solution in a decision tree does not really require an informed search algorithm as it does not need any additional information beyond the root and the first solution goal node. As well as that the problem formulation for search algorithm needs the path cost, goal test, Description of what each action does (Transition Model), Description of possible actions available to the agent in each state and initial state.

Afterwards we studied uninformed search algorithms such as Breadth first, depth first and uniform cast search. And we learned whether or not these were optimal, complete, their time complexity and space complexity as well as how they work. 

Then we studied informed search where we covered complete and admissable heuristics, as well as greedy best first search and A*search. With those components we then did a programming assignment for this chapter which has a presentation visible on the following link - https://youtu.be/oAyXamHATFY.
The jupyter notebook of this project is also available in this same repository under the name of Chapter3Notebook.ipynb 


### Chapter IV - Beyond classical search

In this chapter we covered the simulated annealing search, hill-climbing, local beam search, genetic algorithms local search in continuous spaces, Online and Offline search. It was a long chapter with pretty complex topics and in which we had another programming assignment of which a link to our presentation is the following - https://youtu.be/hv3zI87VeVU.
