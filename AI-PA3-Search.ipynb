    "## Abstract\n",
    "This assignment explores two classical search problems in artificial intelligence. The shortest path problem with convex polygonal obstacle and the well known missionaries and cannibals. The first problem involves navigating a two-dimensional plane with obstacle, requiring definition of a structured state space and the implementation of a search algorithm to determine the shortest path. The second problem is a constraint based river using limited capacity boat while ensuring that missionaries are never outnumbered. The study formulates precise problems representations, defines appropriate state spaces, and applies search algorithm to find optimal solutions. Through the analysis, we assess the computational complexity and challenges associated with these problems, highlighting key heuristics and performance considerations. It provides insights into the difficulty of solving these puzzles despite their seemingly simple state spaces, demonstrating the importance of well defined problem representations and efficient search strategies in artificial intelligence.

    "## Introduction\n",
    "Our assignment begins with a spatial navigation challenge, as depicted in Figure 3.31, where we are tasked with finding the shortest path between points 'S' (start) and 'G' (goal) amidst a field of convex polygonal obstacles. This problem serves as an abstraction of robotic navigation in complex environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have laid the groundwork by defining the state space and implementing the ACTIONS function, which determines feasible moves between polygon vertices. We have also established a heuristic function based on straight-line distance to guide our search. Now, we move to the next phase: applying and evaluating various search algorithms to solve this pathfinding problem. We will implement and compare algorithms such as [mention specific algorithms you plan to use, e.g., A*, Dijkstra's, Breadth-First Search]. Our goal is to analyze the performance of these algorithms in terms of solution optimality, computational efficiency, and memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following this exploration of spatial search, we will transition to the classic 'Missionaries and Cannibals' puzzle, outlined in problem 3.9. This problem, a cornerstone of AI problem formulation, requires us to develop a strategy to safely transport three missionaries and three cannibals across a river, adhering to strict safety constraints. We will implement [mention algorithms, e.g., Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, A*] to navigate the state space and determine the optimal sequence of boat trips. We will also investigate the impact of checking for repeated states on the efficiency and correctness of our solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through these implementations and analyses, we aim to not only solve the specific problems posed but also to gain a deeper understanding of the principles underlying search algorithms. By examining their strengths, weaknesses, and applicability to diverse problem domains, we will develop a robust framework for approaching and solving complex search challenges."

    "## Information & Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the figure 3.31 of the book we must consider how to find the shortest path between two points on a plane that has\n",
    "convex polygonal obstacles. We visualize this as a robot traversing a complex environment. If we were to suppose that the state space consists of all positions x and y in this plane we must first understand how many states there are. If it is mentioned that the state space consists of all positions in x and y we can understand this to have no dicretization of positions, therefore (2,3) is as much as a position as (2.0004, 9.345). With this example if we were to make any minor movement no matter how small we would be creating a new state, therefore we come to the conclusion that we have an infinite number of states. Following a very similar logic any minor adjustment to our path would make it a different path to the previous one, therefore we can also conclude that there are an infinite number of paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the ideal paths we need to know how these will be drawn. If \"In Euclidean geometry, the straight line represents the shortest path between two points.\" Then we should know that these will be straight lines as any curves will be additional distance that could be cut out by just using a vertice. A good way to define state spaces would be setting all of the vertices of the polygons, plus the start and goal points. Now in this state space all we have to do is count the vertices, the goal and the starting point. In this case we have eight polygonal obstacles, four of which have four vertices, two of which have three vertices, and finally two with five and six respectively. If we do the math and add up the last two states which consider the starting state and the goal state, we would have a total of 35 states in this particular example using figure 3.31.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first code in this report, we defined what we believed to be the necessary functions that take a vertex as input and returns a set of vectors, each of which maps the current vertex to one of the vertices that can be reached in a straight line. We included a function to find any neighbors on the same polygon, and we used a straight line for the heuristic function. We also created a test code and implemented breadth first search, depth search first and A* search algortihms in a smaller scale map with only two obstacles. We can observe that Breadth first search only travels approximately half the distance of depth first search, and A* is slightly more efficient than BFS.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the following exercise we consider the Missionaries and Cannibals problem. The Missionaries and Cannibals problem is a classic AI puzzle that involves safely transporting three missionaries and three cannibals across a river using a boat that can hold up to two people. The key challenge is ensuring that missionaries are never outnumbered by cannibals on either side, as that would result in them being eaten. To solve this optimally, the algorithm employs Breadth First Search, a graph traversal technique that explores all possible states level by level, guaranteeing the shortest solution. The process begins by defining a function to check if a state is valid, ensuring that missionaries are never outnumbered at any point. Another function generates all possible next states based on legal boat movements. The algorithm then starts from the initial state and systematically explores each valid move until it reaches the goal state. The final output presents the optimal sequence of moves required to solve the puzzle.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment successfully navigated the complexities of two distinct search problems in artificial intelligence: shortest path planning amidst polygonal obstacles and the classic Missionaries and Cannibals puzzle. By meticulously defining state spaces, implementing appropriate search algorithms, and analyzing their performance, we gained valuable insights into the fundamental principles of AI search.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the spatial navigation challenge, we transitioned from an infinite state space to a discrete representation using polygon vertices, effectively transforming a continuous problem into a graph search. The implementation of A*, Breadth-First Search, and Depth-First Search algorithms highlighted the trade-offs between solution optimality, computational efficiency, and memory usage. Specifically, A* demonstrated its efficiency by leveraging a heuristic to guide the search, while Breadth-First Search ensured optimality at the cost of increased memory consumption. The testing of these algorithms on a smaller scale map effectively showcased the differences between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Missionaries and Cannibals problem further emphasized the importance of constraint satisfaction and optimal pathfinding. By employing Breadth-First Search and implementing state validity checks, we successfully determined the optimal sequence of boat trips to safely transport the missionaries and cannibals across the river. This exercise underscored the significance of well-defined problem representations and efficient search strategies in solving constraint-based puzzles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through these explorations, we observed that seemingly simple problems can present significant computational challenges, particularly when dealing with large or infinite state spaces. The success of our implementations relied heavily on the ability to discretize continuous problems, define effective heuristics, and implement robust state validation checks. Our analysis underscored the importance of selecting appropriate search algorithms based on the specific requirements of the problem, such as solution optimality, computational efficiency, and memory constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, this assignment provided a comprehensive understanding of the practical applications and theoretical underpinnings of AI search algorithms. It reinforced the importance of careful problem formulation, efficient algorithm selection, and rigorous performance evaluation in tackling complex search challenges. These lessons are invaluable for future work in AI, where the ability to navigate and solve intricate problems is paramount.\n"
